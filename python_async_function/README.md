# 🐍 Python - Async

Welcome to the **Python - Async** project! 🎉 This repository focuses on asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio`. You will learn the fundamentals of `async` and `await` syntax, how to run coroutines concurrently, and how to manage tasks. ✨

---

## 📋 Tasks Overview

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-basic_async_syntax` | ⏰ Basic async coroutine with random delays |
| `1-concurrent_coroutines` | 🚀 Execute multiple coroutines concurrently |
| `2-measure_runtime` | ⏱️ Measure execution time of async functions |
| `3-tasks` | 📦 Create asyncio Tasks |
| `4-tasks` | 🔄 Altered version using Tasks |

## 🎯 Concepts Covered

- ✅ `async` and `await` syntax
- ✅ Running async programs with `asyncio`
- ✅ Concurrent coroutine execution
- ✅ Creating and managing `asyncio` tasks
- ✅ Using the `random` module for delays

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

> 💡 By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- 🗣️ Explain `async` and `await` syntax
- 🏃 Execute an async program with `asyncio`
- 🔀 Run concurrent coroutines
- 📦 Create `asyncio` tasks
- 🎲 Use the `random` module for creating delays

## ⚙️ Requirements

- 🐧 Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- 📏 pycodestyle (v2.5.*) compliance
- 🚀 Executable files with shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- 📚 Documentation and type annotations for all modules, functions, and coroutines
