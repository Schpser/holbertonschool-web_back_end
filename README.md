# 🎓 Holberton School - Web Back End 🚀

This repository contains back-end projects developed by a student at **Holberton School**. The focus is on modern Python concepts, including variable annotations, asynchronous programming, and async comprehensions.

## 📚 Projects

This repository is organized into the following projects:

*   `python_variable_annotations` 🏷️: This project covers the use of type annotations for variables in Python, promoting code clarity and maintainability.
*   `python_async` ⚡: This project explores asynchronous programming in Python using `async` and `await` syntax, essential for building high-performance I/O-bound applications.
*   `python_async_comprehension` 🔄: This project delves into async comprehensions, providing a concise way to work with asynchronous iterators.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.7** or higher installed on your system.

Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Schpser/holbertonschool-web_back_end.git
```

### 🔧 Installation

There are no special installation steps required for the Python scripts in this project. You can run them directly using the Python interpreter.

## 📋 Requirements

*   Python 3.7+ 🐍
*   `pycodestyle` for code linting (version 2.5.*) ✨

You can install the linter using pip:
```bash
pip install pycodestyle==2.5.*
```

## 💻 Usage

Navigate to the project directory you are interested in and run the Python files.

For example, to run a file from the `python_variable_annotations` project:
```bash
cd holbertonschool-web_back_end/python_variable_annotations
python3 0-add.py
```
