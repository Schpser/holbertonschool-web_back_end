# 🐍 Python - Async Comprehension

Welcome to the **Python - Async Comprehension** project! 🎉 This repository focuses on advanced asynchronous programming in Python, specifically `async` generators and comprehensions. You will learn how to create asynchronous generators, use them with async comprehensions, and measure the performance of concurrent tasks. ✨

---

## 📋 Tasks Overview

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `0-async_generator` | 🔄 Create a basic asynchronous generator |
| `1-async_comprehension` | 🚀 Use an async comprehension to collect values |
| `2-measure_runtime` | ⏱️ Measure the runtime of parallel comprehensions |

## 🎯 Concepts Covered

- ✅ Asynchronous Generators
- ✅ Async Comprehensions
- ✅ `asyncio.gather` for concurrent execution
- ✅ Type-hinting for generators

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

> 💡 By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- 🗣️ Explain and write an asynchronous generator
- 🔄 Use async comprehensions to process async iterables
- 🚀 Run and measure concurrent asynchronous tasks
- ✍️ Apply type-annotations to generators and coroutines

## ⚙️ Requirements

- 🐧 Python 3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- 📏 pycodestyle (v2.5.*) compliance
- 🚀 Executable files with shebang `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- 📚 Documentation and type annotations for all modules, functions, and coroutines
